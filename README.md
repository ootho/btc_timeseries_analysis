## The purpose and objectives of the project  
  
Main purpose is to attempt to predict price movement for the next day.  
In order to do that we will use multivariate time-series with many financial indicators like stock-to-flow, fear-greed index and so on.  Main idea of this attepmt is to use `mined blocks` instead of time on `x` axis in order to halving cycles be more regular.
